**EXPERIMENT #1**

Listen to the surrounding sounds and their most frequent patterns that come into your focus as if they were different echoes of the whole sound picture of sleeping yourself.

What do you hear from the “upper level" if it is reflected here by such sounds?

What are the common patterns in these sounds and what could be their common source?

What do they resemble if you do not follow the path of usual interpretation, but perceive them directly?

By recreating the sound picture of the “upper” level more clearly, it will be easier to move the focus of consciousness into your “upper level".



**Advanced excercise**

Do the same experiment with the visual environment, smells, taste, tactile senses. Try to combine them into a single picture.
